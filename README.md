## Title: Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

### A. Project Overview:
This project aimed to predict customer churn in the telecom industry.

### B. Dataset Description: 
The dataset comprised 21 columns, including customer information, service subscriptions, and demographic data.
We will be using the following dataset:

      WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv
-----

### C. Objectives:

### 1. Churn Analysis:
* Explored the data to determine the percentage of churned customers and those who remained with active services.

### 2. Gender-based Analysis:
* Investigated patterns in churn customers based on gender.

### 3. Service Preference:
* Explored customer churn based on the type of services provided.
      
### 4. Profitable Services:
* Identified the most profitable service types.

---
### D. Data Exploration and Visualization:
* Utilized the Missingno library to visualize missing values in the dataset.
* Performed data manipulation, including handling missing values.

### E. Data Preprocessing:
* Converted object data types to integers using LabelEncoder.
* Standardized numeric attributes to ensure data consistency and enhance model performance.

### F. Machine Learning Models:
Implemented several classification algorithms, including:
 * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 * Random Forest
 * Logistic Regression
 * Decision Tree
 * AdaBoost
 * Gradient Boost
 * Voting Classifier.

### G. Model Evaluation:
* Calculated accuracy scores, generated classification reports, and visualized confusion matrices and ROC AUC curves.
* Identified **Random Forest** as the top-performing model with an accuracy of **81.4%.**
